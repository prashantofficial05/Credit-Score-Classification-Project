# Credit-Score-Classification-Project


Credit Score Classification
There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

Good
Standard
Poor
A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores.

I found an ideal dataset for this task labelled according to the credit history of credit card customers.

Classifying customers based on their credit scores helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution.
